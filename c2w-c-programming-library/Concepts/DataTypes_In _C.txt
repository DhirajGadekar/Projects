Data Types -:

Data type in C programming Language are used to specify what kind of value can be stored in a variable
The memory size and type of value of a variable are determined by the variable Data types.

In the C Language, data types are classifed are as follows,

Basically their are 3 types of data type in C.

                 1)Pre-defned Data Type.

                 2)Derived Data Type.

                 3)User-defned Data Type.



1)Pre-defined Data Type :-

          All the Pre-defned data types are already defned in the system . Pre-defned data types are

         also called as Built-in data types. The Following are the Pre-defned data types in C-Language .

        i] Integer Data Type :-

       Integer Data type is a set of Whole Numbers.

        ex . int var = 10;

       We use keyword "int" to represent the integer data type in C.

       The integer data types is used with diferent types of modifers like short,long,signed and
        unsigned.

       The memory size of integer is 4 bytes i.e. 32 bits in C (1 byte = 8 bits).

       The format specifer is used for integer data type is " %d ".



        III]Character Data Type :-

       The character data type is a set of characters enclosed in Single Quotatons.

        ex . char c = 'A';

       we use keyword "char" to represent the character data type in C.

       The memory size of character is 1 byte i.e. 8 bits in C.
      The format specifer in used for char data type is " %c ".



        ii]Float Data Type :-

      Float data type are a set of numbers with the decimal value.

       ex . foat f = 10.000;

      we use keyword "foat" to represent the foat data type in C.

      The memory size of foat in 4 bytes i.e. 32 bits in C (1 byte = 8 bits).

      The format specifer is used for foat data type is " %f ".



        iv]Double Data Type :-

      The Double data type are a set of numbers with the decimal value but here the decimal places
       are 15 or 19 .

       ex . double d = 100.00000;

      we use keyword "double" to represent the double data type in C.

      The memory size of double is 8 byte i.e 64 bits in C.

      The format specifer is used for double data type is " %lf ".



        v]Void Data Type :-

      The void data type means nothing or no value.

      The minimum memory for void is 1 byte.



2)Derived Data Type :- Derived data types are derived from Pre-defned types.

       The following are the Derived data types in C- Language...,

       i] Array :-

      Array is the collecton of Similar data type.

      We can store the multple values in Single Variable Name in Array.
   Syntax : data_type Var_Name[ size ] ;

    ex. int arr[10];

    ii] Pointer :-

   The Pointer is a variable which stores the address of another variable.

   We Can Store the address of any data using Pointer.

   The Size of Pointer is 8 byte.

   Syntax : data_type *Var_name = Address.

    ex . int x = 10;

       int *ptr = &x;

   We Can Access the Variable using the pointer i.e store the address of variable.



    iii] Functon :-

   A Functon is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

   You can pass the data , Known as arguments and Catch the data int functon know as
    Parameters.

   Functons are used to perform certain actons.

   Functons are Used to reduce the Redundancy Of Code.

   Defne the Code Once and used is many tmes...

   Syntax : return_type Functon_Name ( parameters );

    ex . void fun(){ ... return type is void with Zero parameters.

             int x = 10;

             printf("%d\n",x);

             }

        void main(){

              fun();    ... Call the functon with zero Arguments.

             }
3)User-defned Data type :- User defned data types are derived from Pre-defned data type and

      Derived data type.

      The following are user-defned data type in C...,

      i] Structure :-

     Structures are the group of several related variables in one place.

     Each variable in structure are know as member of structure.

     We use " struct " keyword to represent the structure in C.

     Structure can contain many diferent data type like int , foat , char , double etc.

     Syntax : struct structure_Name {

                        data_type var_name;

                        data_type var_name;

               };

      ex . struct playerName{

               char pName[20];

               int jerNo;

               foat avg;

               };

      ii] Union :-

     Union is also a group of several related variables in one place as like structure.

     We use " union " keyword to reprsent the Union in C.

     Union can Contain many Diferent data type but one diference is related to memory.

     In Union , Base size is Highest Fixed data type.

     Their are multple data type in union but they get memory at a tme one only.

     Syntax : union union_Name{

                        data_type var_name;
                      data_type var_name;

            };

    ex . union empData{

            char empName[20];

            int empId;

            foat salary;

    };



    iii] Enumeration :-

   Enumeraton is bydefault " Integer " Contant.

   Syntax : enum enum_Name{

                      name1,

                      name2,

                      name3

            };

    ex . enum Partners{

            PramodSir,

            ShashiSir,

            SachinSir,

            ShriSir

    };
