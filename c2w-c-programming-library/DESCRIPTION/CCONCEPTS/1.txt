	Introduction :-

	1) C is a Procedure Oriented Programming Language Created by ' Dennis Ritchie ' at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.

	2) C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX Operating System.

	3) It is Very Fast as Compared to Other Programming Language like JAVA , Python , C# etc. 

	Syntax :-
			include <stdio.h>
			void main() {

  		     	printf("Hello Core2web Coders !!!");

			}

	Comments in C :-

	1) Comments can be used to explain code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.

	2) The Commented Part Cannot display on Monitor.

	3) Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined.
	
		I) Single Line Comment Starts with the Two Forward Slashes ( // ).
	
			ex.  //This is a Comment.

	      		printf(" C Language By Core2web !!! \n");
	
		II) Multi Line Comment Starts with the  /* and ends with  */ .

	      	Any text between  /*  and  */  is ignore by the Compiler.

			ex .  /* This Text Ignore By the Compiler */
			
		       	printf(" C Language By Core2web !!! \n");


	C Variables :-

	1) Variables are Container to Store the data Value like Numbers and Characters.

	2) C Variables must be identified with unique Names.

	3) The Unique Nmaes is Called as Identifier.

	4) Synatx :  data_type_Name   varName =  value ;
	
	          	ex :  int  var = 10;

	5) We can give the Any Name to the Variable.

		ex : int myNum = 10;

	       	#include<stdio.h>
	       	void main() {
		
			int myNum = 10;
			printf("%d\n",myNum);		// Access the Variable.

	   	}

	6) The general rules for naming variables are:

		i)   Names can contain letters, digits and underscores.
		ii)  Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_).
		iii) Names are case sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables).
		iv) Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.
		v)  Reserved words (such as int) cannot be used as names.

	C Keywords :-

	1) Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in programming that have special meanings to the compiler.

	2) Keywords are part of the syntax and they cannot be used as an identifier.
	
		ex : int var;	// ' int ' is a keyword and  ' var ' is a Identifier.

	3) C Keywords ...
