	Data Types In C -:

	Data type in C programming Language are used to specify what kind of value can be stored in a variable
	The memory size and type of value of a variable are determined by the variable Data types.

	In the C Language, data types are classifed are as follows,

	Basically their are 3 types of data type in C.

                 	1)Pre-defned Data Type.

                 	2)Derived Data Type.

                 	3)User-defned Data Type.



	1)Pre-defined Data Type :-

          	All the Pre-defned data types are already defned in the system . Pre-defned data types are

         	also called as Built-in data types. The Following are the Pre-defned data types in C-Language .

	i] Integer Data Type :-

     	1)   Integer Data type is a set of Whole Numbers.
            	ex . int var = 10;

     	2)   We use keyword "int" to represent the integer data type in C.

     	3)   The integer data types is used with diferent types of modifers like short,long,signed and
                   unsigned.

     	4)   The memory size of integer is 4 bytes i.e. 32 bits in C (1 byte = 8 bits).

     	5)   The format specifer is used for integer data type is " %d ".


 	ii]Character Data Type :-

    	1)   The character data type is a set of characters enclosed in Single Quotatons.

        		ex . char c = 'A';

    	2)   we use keyword "char" to represent the character data type in C.

    	3)   The memory size of character is 1 byte i.e. 8 bits in C.
    	4)   The format specifer in used for char data type is " %c ".


	iii]Float Data Type :-

   	1)   Float data type are a set of numbers with the decimal value.
          		ex . float f = 10.000;

   	2)   we use keyword "foat" to represent the foat data type in C.

   	3)   The memory size of foat in 4 bytes i.e. 32 bits in C (1 byte = 8 bits).

   	4)   The format specifer is used for foat data type is " %f ".


	iv]Double Data Type :-

   	1)   The Double data type are a set of numbers with the decimal value but here the decimal places
          	       are 15 or 19.

         	 	ex . double d = 100.00000;

   	2)  we use keyword "double" to represent the double data type in C.

   	3)   The memory size of double is 8 byte i.e 64 bits in C.

   	4)   The format specifer is used for double data type is " %lf ".


	v]Void Data Type :-

   	1)   The void data type means nothing or no value.

   	2)   The minimum memory for void is 1 byte.



	2)Derived Data Type :-
 
			 Derived data types are derived from Pre-defned types.

       		 	The following are the Derived data types in C- Language...,

    	i] Array :-

   	1)   Array is the collecton of Similar data type.

   	2)   We can store the multple values in Single Variable Name in Array.
   	3)   Syntax : data_type Var_Name[ size ] ;
          		ex. int arr[10];

	ii] Pointer :-

    	1)  The Pointer is a variable which stores the address of another variable.

    	2)  We Can Store the address of any data using Pointer.

    	3)  The Size of Pointer is 8 byte.

    	4)  Syntax : data_type *Var_name = Address.

          		ex . int x = 10;

                	int *ptr = &x;

    	5)  We Can Access the Variable using the pointer i.e store the address of variable.


	iii] Functon :-

   	1)  A Functon is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

   	2)  You can pass the data , Known as arguments and Catch the data int functon know as
        	      Parameters.

   	3)  Functons are used to perform certain actons.

   	4)  Functons are Used to reduce the Redundancy Of Code.
 
   	5)  Defne the Code Once and used is many tmes...

   	6)  Syntax : return_type Functon_Name ( parameters );

         		ex . void fun(){ ... return type is void with Zero parameters.

             		int x = 10;
             		printf("%d\n",x);
             		}

             	      void main(){

                  		fun();    ... Call the functon with zero Arguments.

               	}

	3)User-defned Data type :-
		 	User defned data types are derived from Pre-defned data type and
      		 	Derived data type.

      			The following are user-defned data type in C...,

	i] Structure :-

   	1)   Structures are the group of several related variables in one place.

   	2)   Each variable in structure are know as member of structure.

   	3)  We use " struct " keyword to represent the structure in C.

   	4)  Structure can contain many diferent data type like int , foat , char , double etc.

   	5)  Syntax : struct structure_Name {

                        	data_type var_name;

                        	data_type var_name;

               	};

      		ex . struct playerName{

               	      char pName[20];

               	      int jerNo;

               	      float avg;

               	};

	ii] Union :-
 
   	1)  Union is also a group of several related variables in one place as like structure.

   	2)  We use " union " keyword to reprsent the Union in C.

   	3)  Union can Contain many Diferent data type but one diference is related to memory.

   	4)  In Union , Base size is Highest Fixed data type.

   	5)  Their are multple data type in union but they get memory at a tme one only.

   	6)  Syntax : union union_Name{

                        	data_type var_name;
                      		data_type var_name;

            	};

    	ex . union empData{

                   char empName[20];

                   int empId;

                  float salary;

    	};



    	iii] Enumeration :-

   	1)  Enumeraton is bydefault " Integer " Contant.

   	2)  Syntax : enum enum_Name{

                      	name1,

                      	name2,

                      	name3

            	};

    	ex . enum Partners{

            	PramodSir,

            	ShashiSir,

            	SachinSir,

            	ShriSir
    	};
