	C-Preprocessor Directive- :-

	C is a unique programming language in many respects. We have already seen features such as structures and pointers. Yet another unique		feature of the C programming language is preprocessor.

	The preprocessor, as its name implies, is a program that processes the source code before it passes through the compiler.

	Preprocessor directives follow special syntax They all begin With the symbol ‘#’,and not requiring any semicolon at the end.

	Preprocessors are required before the main() function.

	We have already used #define as well as #include at limited places.


	1) Macros :-	 i] Object Like Macros.
            		ii] Function Like Macros.


	i] Object Like Macros:-

	#include<stdio.h>
	#define xyz 10
	#define int char

	void main(){

        		printf("%d\n",xyz);     		//In preprocessor Stage, xyz is replace by 10. (i.e. printf("%d\n",10); )

        		printf("%ld\n",sizeof(char));   	//This replace by in preprocessing Stage :- printf("%ld\n",sizeof(char));

	}


	ii] Function Like Macros:-
        		- In Function Like Macros , their is no push pop Operation for function.
        		- In preprocessing Stage they replace the instruction.
        		- Only use for small function i.e. one line instructions.
        		- It is same as that of 'Inline Function' in C++.

		ex :
			#include<stdio.h>

			#define add(a,b)  a+b
			#define sqr(x)    x*x

			void main(){

        				int x=10;
        				int y=20;

        				printf("Add = %d\n",add(x,y));  		//This Replace by in preprocessing Stage :- printf("%d\n",x+y);
        				printf("Square = %d\n",sqr(x)); 		//This Replace by in Preprocessing Stage :- printf("%d\n",x*x);
	}


	2) PreDefined Macros:-

		#include<stdio.h>

		void main(){

        			printf("%s\n",__FILE__);
        			printf("%s\n",__DATE__);
        			printf("%s\n",__TIME__);
        			printf("%d\n",__LINE__);
	}


	Conditional PreProcessing :-

	#include<stdio.h>
	#define access 1

	void main(){

        		#if access
                	printf("Access\n");     //Access

        		#else
                	printf("Not-Access\n");

        		#endif
                	printf("EOF\n");        //EOF

	}



	#include header File Directive :-
        			1) #include<stdio.h> :- Search functions declaration PreDefined Header file.

        			2) #include"stdio.h" :- Search in User Defined header File.
						     Search header file in Current Directory.
