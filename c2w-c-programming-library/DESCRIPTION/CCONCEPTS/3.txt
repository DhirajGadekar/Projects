	C Operators :- 

		Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
 
		C Divides the operators in following groups...,

			I)  Unary Operators.

	           		II)  Arithmetic Operators.

	          		III)  Assignment Operators.

	          		IV)  Comparison Operators.

			V)  Logical Operators.

	          		VI)  Bitwise Operators.

	I)Unary Operators :-

		1)  unary Operators that act upon a just a single operand for Performing operations.

            	2)  All the unary operators have equal precebdence and their associativity is from left to right.

		3)  we get combine the unary operator with an operand, we get the unary expression.

		4)  Incerement and decrement are two types of Operators are combine with single operand to perform the operations.

		5)  Increment ( ++ )  have two types i.e., PreIncrement (++a) and PostIncrement ( a++ ).

		6)  Decrement ( -- ) have two types i.e., PreDecrement (--a) and PostDecrement ( a-- ).	

		ex 1) . int x = 10;
	       		int y = ++x;	...PreIncrement.

	       		output : y=11.

			int x = 10;
	       		int y = x++;   ...PostIncrement.

	       		output : y=10.

		ex 2) . int z = 20;
	            	int  x = --z;  ...PreDecrement.

	            	output : z=19

			int z = 20;
	            	int x = z--;   ...PostDecrement.

	            	output : z=20.

	2)Arithmetic Operators :-

		Arithmetic Operators are used to perform common Mathematical Operations.

		Operator	     Name	  	   Description			Example

	       	+                  Addition	          Adds together Two Values	                x + y

	        	-	             Substraction         Substract one value from other	    x - y

	       	*               Multiplication        Multiplies Two Values		    x * y

	       	/		 Division	          Divides one value from other	    x / y

	       	%		 Modulus	          Returns the division remainder	    x % y


	3)Assignment Operators :-

		Assignment Operators are used to assign values to Variables.

		Operator		Example	 Same As
		
	      	=                     		x=5		   x=5		
		
	      	+=	                 	x+=3		  x = x + 3

	       	-=                   		x-=5	              x = x - 5		
	   
	       	*=		     	x*=2	              x = x * 2
	
	       	/=		     	x/=2		  x = x / 2

   	       	%=	     		x%=10	              x = x % 10


	4)Comparison Operators :-

         		•Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables).
         		•The return value of a comparison is either 1 or 0, which means true (1) or false (0).

		Operator		Name				Example
	  	  		
	      	==                          Equal To	 		x == y	
		   
	      	!=	              Not Equal to 		x != y	
		    
	       	>                	Greater than		 	x > y	
			    	
	       	<		less than                                x < y	

	       	>=		Greater then equal to	x >= y	
		    
   	       	<=		less than equal to	   	x <= y	


	5)Logical Operators :-

         		•Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or value.
	
		Operator	Name			Description								Example

	    	&& 		logical AND       Returns true if both statements are true	  	 	x<5 && x<10

	     	||     		logical OR          Returns true if one of the statements true	   	             x<5 || x<4

	     	 !		logical NOT       Reverse the result,returns false if the result  		!(x<5 &&x<10)
 				                	    is true 

	6)Bitwise Operators :-

		Bitwise operators are characters that represent actions (bitwise operations) to be performed on single bits.	

		Operator	Name				Example

	    	& 		bitwise AND    	        x=5 & y=9    int a = (x&y)

	     	|     		bitwise OR         	        x=5 | y=9    int a = (x|y)

	     	^		bitwise XOR	       	        x=5 ^ y=9    int a = (x^y)     
  
	    	>>		left shift	                    x=5 >> y=9  int a = (x>>y)

	   	<<		right shift	                    x=5 << y=9  int a = (x<<y)


	Truth Table :-

	1) AND :-

		T     T		T

		T     F		F

		F     T		F

		F     F		F

	2) OR :-

		T     T		T

		T     F		T

		F     T		T

		F     F		F

	3) XOR :-

		T     T		F

		T     F		T

		F     T		T

		F     F		F
