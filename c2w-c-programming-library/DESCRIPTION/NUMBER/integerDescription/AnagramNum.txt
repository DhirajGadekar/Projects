		Anagram Numbers:

	DESCRIPTION: 

		Just like strings, a number is said to be an anagram of some 
		other number if it can be made equal to the other number by 
		just shuffling the digits in it.

        EXAMPLE:
        
		Input: A = 204, B = 240 
		Output: Numbers Are Angrams
	
		Input: A = 23, B = 959 
		Output: Numbers Are Not Anagrams
