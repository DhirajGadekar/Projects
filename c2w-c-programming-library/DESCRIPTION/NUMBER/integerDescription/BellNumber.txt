		Bell Number:
		
	DESCRIPTION: 

    		In combinatorial mathematics, the Bell numbers count the possible partitions of a set.  
    		Let S(n, k) be total number of partitions of n elements into k sets. The value of n’th 
    		Bell Number is sum of S(n, k) for k = 1 to n. 
    		Value of S(n, k) can be defined recursively as, S(n+1, k) = k*S(n, k) + S(n, k-1)
    		
    	EXAMPLE:
    	
    		The first Bell numbers are: 1, 1, 2, 5, 15, 52, 203, 877, 4140, 21147, 115975.
