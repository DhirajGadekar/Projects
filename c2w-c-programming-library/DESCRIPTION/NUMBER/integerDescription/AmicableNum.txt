		Ambicable Number:
		
	DESCRIPTION: 

		An amicable pair of  numbers consists of two 
		different  integers  where  the  sum  of the 
		divisors  of  the  first integer is equal to 
		the  second  integer,  and  the  sum  of the 
		divisors  of  the second integer is equal to
		the  first  integer.A perfect number is a 
		number that equals the sum of its own divisors.
 
		
	EXAMPLE:
	        
	        1184 and 1210 are an almost perfect number pair. 
	        1184 = 1+2+5+10+11+22+55+110+121+242+605,
	        the sum of the divisors of 1210.
