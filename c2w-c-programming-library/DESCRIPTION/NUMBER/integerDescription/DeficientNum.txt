		Deficient Number:

        DESCRIPTION: 
        
        	In number theory, a deficient number or defective number is a number 
		n for which the sum of divisors of n is less than 2n. 
    		Equivalently, it is a number for which the sum of proper divisors is
		less than n.
		
	EXAMPLE:
	 
	 	the proper divisors of 8 are 1, 2, and 4,
		and their sum is less than 8, so 8 is deficient.
