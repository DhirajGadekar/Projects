		Automorphic Number:
		
	DESCRIPTION: 

    		In mathematics, an automorphic number is a natural number in a 
    		given number base b whose square "ends" in the same digits as the 
    		number itself.
    		
    	EXAMPLE:
    	
    		Enter a number to check: 625
		625 is an automorphic number.
		
		Enter a number to check: 312
		312 is not an automorphic number.
