		Niven Number
	
	DESCRIPTION:
		
		A harshad number (or Niven number) in a given number base is an
    		integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits when written 
    		in that base. 
    	
    	EXAMPLE:
    		
    		108 is a Niven number 
    		because 1 + 0 + 8 = 9 and 108 is divisible by 9 
    		(many, but not all, multiples of 9 are Niven numbers).
