		Sum of factors
		
	DESCRIPTION:
    		
    		Factors are the numbers that can divide a number exactly.  Hence, after 
    		division, there is no remainder left.
    		Factors are the numbers you multiply together to get another number.
    		Thus, a factor is the divisor of another number.
    		
    	EXAMPLE:
    	
    		Input :  n = 15
		Output : 24
		Sum Of Fcators : 1 + 3 + 5 + 15 = 24
