		Prime Number
		
	DESCRIPTION:
		
		Prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product 
    		of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that 
    		is not prime is called a composite number. 
	
	EXAMPLE: 
		
		5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 
		
		1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself.
