            2. SORT ARRAY ASCENDING

        DESCRIPTION :

            In this program, we need to sort the given array in ascending 
            order such that elements will be arranged from smallest to largest.         
            This can be achieved through two loops. The outer loop will select 
            an element, and inner loop allows us to compare selected element 
            with rest of the elements.

        EXAMPLE :

            INPUT ARRAY :

                | 5 | 2 | 8 | 7 | 1 |
            
            OUTPUT ARRAY :

                | 1 | 2 | 5 | 7 | 8 |
