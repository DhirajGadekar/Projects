            38. GROUPING OF ABUNDANT

        DESCRIPTION :   
            
            A number n is said to be an Abundant Number if the sum of         
            all the proper divisors of the number denoted by sum(n) is              
            greater than the value of the number n.   

            This function takes array address and array length as input     
            and group Abundant elements in array.  

        EXAMPLE :   
            
            INPUT ARRAY :  
        
                | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 20 |    
        
            OUTPUT ARRAY :
