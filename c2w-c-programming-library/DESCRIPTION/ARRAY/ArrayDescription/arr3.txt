            3. SORT ARRAY DESCENDING

        DESCRIPTION :

            In this program, we need to sort the given array in descending
            order such that elements will be arranged from largest to smallest.     
            This can be achieved through two loops. Outer loop will select a 
            element and inner loop allow us to compare selected element with 
            rest of the elements.

        EXAMPLE :   

            INPUT ARRAY :

                | 5 | 2 | 8 | 7 | 1 |
            
            OUTPUT ARRAY :

                | 8 | 7 | 5 | 2 | 1 |
