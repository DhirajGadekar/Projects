			In his approach, we have to traverse through the array
			using a for loop, and then for each element in the array, 
			we use another array to count any duplicate element on its				
			right. Whenever we find a duplicate element, we increase the 
			count by one and break the inner loop.

				Array has 2 duplicate Number
