        ADD NODE AT FIRST

    DESCRIPTION:
	      
		A Singly Linked List is a specialized case of a generic linked list. 
        In a singly linked list, each node links to only the next node in the sequence, 
        i.e if we start traversing from the first node of the list, we can only move in one direction(pun intended).

        Insertion at the start Insertion of a new node at the start of a singly linked list is carried out in the following manner.

        1.Make the new node point to HEAD.
        2.Make the HEAD point to the new node.
        3.Inserting a new node at the start is an O(1) operation.

	EXAMPLE:

        Input:
		    |10|-->|20|-->|30|-->|40|

        Output:
		    |50|-->|10|-->|20|-->|30|-->|40|
                     |
                     |
                  newNode
