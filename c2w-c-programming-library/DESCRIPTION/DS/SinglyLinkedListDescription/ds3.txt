      SELECTED METHOD:

            ADD NODE AT LAST

      DESCRIPTION:

            A Singly Linked List is a specialized case of a generic linked list.
            In a singly linked list, each node links to only the next node in the sequence,
            i.e if we start traversing from the first node of the list, we can only move in one direction(pun intended)

            Insertion at the end Insertion of a new node at the end of a singly linked list is performed in the following way:

            1.Traverse the list from start and reach the last node.
            2.Make the last node point to the new node.
            3.Make the new node point to null, marking the end of the list. 
            4.Inserting a new node at the end is an O(N) operation.

      EXAMPLE:

            Input:

                  |10|-->|20|-->|30|-->|40|
                  
            Output:
                  |10|-->|20|-->|30|-->|40|-->|50|
                                                |
                                                |
                                             newNode
