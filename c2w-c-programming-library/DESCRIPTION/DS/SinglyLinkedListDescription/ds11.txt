            DELETE NODE AT POSITION

      DESCRIPTION:

            A Singly Linked List is a specialized case of a generic linked list. 
            In a singly linked list, each node links to only the next node in the sequence, 
            i.e if we start traversing from the first node of the list, we can only move in one direction(pun intended).

            The deletion after a specific node can be formed in the following way,

            1.Reach the desired node after which the node is to be deleted.
            2.Make the current node point to the next of next element.
            3.Deleting a node after a specific node is an O(N) operation.

      EXAMPLE:

            Input:
                  |10|-->|20|-->|30|-->|40|
                  Pos:2

            Output:
                  |10|-->|30|-->|40|
