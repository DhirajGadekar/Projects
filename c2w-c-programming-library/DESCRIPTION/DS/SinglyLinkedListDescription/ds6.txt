            DELETE FIRST NODE 

      DESCRIPTION:

            A Singly Linked List is a specialized case of a generic linked list. 
            In a singly linked list, each node links to only the next node in the sequence, 
            i.e if we start traversing from the first node of the list, we can only move in one direction(pun intended).

            The first node of the singly linked list can be deleted as follows:

            1.Make the HEAD point to its next element.
            2.Deleting the first node of a singly linked list is an O(1) operation.

      EXAMPLE:

            Input:
                  |10|-->|20|-->|30|-->|40|

            Output:
                  |20|-->|30|-->|40|
