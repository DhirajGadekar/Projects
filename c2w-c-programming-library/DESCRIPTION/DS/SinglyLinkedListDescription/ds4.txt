            PRINT NODES IN LINKEDLIST 

      DESCRIPTION:
            
            A Singly Linked List is a specialized case of a generic linked list. 
            In a singly linked list, each node links to only the next node in the sequence, 
            i.e if we start traversing from the first node of the list, we can only move in one direction(pun intended).

            1.To display the entire singly linked list, we need to traverse it from first to last.
            2.In contrast to arrays, linked list nodes cannot be accessed randomly. Hence to reach the n-th element, we are bound to traverse through all (n-1) elements.
            3.Since the entire linked list is traversed, the operation costs us O(N) time complexity.

      EXAMPLE:

            |10|-->|20|-->|30|-->|40|
