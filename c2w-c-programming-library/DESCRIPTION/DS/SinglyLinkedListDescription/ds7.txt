      SELECTED METHOD:

            DELETE LAST NODE 

      DESCRIPTION:
      
            A Singly Linked List is a specialized case of a generic linked list. 
            In a singly linked list, each node links to only the next node in the sequence, 
            i.e if we start traversing from the first node of the list, we can only move in one direction(pun intended).

            The deletion of the last node is performed in the following manner:
                  
            1.Reach the second last node of th singly linked list.
            2.Make the second last node point null.
            3.Deleting the last node is an O(N) operation.
      
      EXAMPLE:

            Input: 
                  |10|-->|20|-->|30|-->|40|

            Output: 
                  |10|-->|20|-->|30|
