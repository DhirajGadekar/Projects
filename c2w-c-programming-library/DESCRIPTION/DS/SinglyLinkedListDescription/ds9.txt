  SELECTED METHOD:

    ADD NODE AT POSITION

  DESCRIPTION:

    A Singly Linked List is a specialized case of a generic linked list. 
    In a singly linked list, each node links to only the next node in the sequence, 
    i.e if we start traversing from the first node of the list, we can only move in one direction(pun intended).

    Insertion after some Node Insertion of a new node after some node in a singly linked list is carried out in the following manner:

    1.Reach the desired node after which the new node is to be inserted.
    2.Make the new node point to the next element of the current node.
    3.Make the current node point to the new node. 
    4.Inserting a new node after some node is an O(N) operation.

  EXAMPLE:

    Input:
      |10|-->|20|-->|30|-->|40|

    Output:
      |10|-->|20|-->|50|-->|30|-->|40
                      |
                      |
                   newNode
