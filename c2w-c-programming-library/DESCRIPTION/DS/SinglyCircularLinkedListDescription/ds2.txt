    SELECTED METHOD:

        ADD NODE AT FIRST

    DESCRIPTION:

        In a circular Singly linked list, the last node of the list contains a pointer to the first node of the list. 
        We traverse the circular singly linked list until we reach the same node where we started. The circular singly 
        linked list has no beginning or end. No null value is present in the next part of any of the nodes
        
        Insertion of a new node at the start of a singly Circular linked list is carried out in the following manner.

        1.Create a newnode and point the next of newnode to the last of newnode(i.e first node)
        2.Make last node point at newnode.
        3.Insert the new node at the start and make head point to newnode. 

      EXAMPLE:

            Input:

                ---->|10|-->|20|-->|30|-->|40|----
                |________________________________|
            
            Output:
                    added node
                       |
                ---->|50|-->|10|-->|20|-->|30|-->|40|----
                |_______________________________________|
