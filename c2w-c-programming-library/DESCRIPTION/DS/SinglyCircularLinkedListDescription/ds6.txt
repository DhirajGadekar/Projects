        DELETE FIRST NODE

    DESCRIPTION:

        In a circular Singly linked list, the last node of the list contains a pointer to the first node of the list. 
        We traverse the circular singly linked list until we reach the same node where we started. The circular singly 
        linked list has no beginning or end. No null value is present in the next part of any of the nodes
        
        The first node of the singly circular linked list can be deleted as follows:
        
        1.Make the head point to its next element.
        2.Making last node point to second node.
        3.Deleting first node using free()

      EXAMPLE:

            Input:

                ---->|10|-->|20|-->|30|-->|40|----
                |________________________________|
            
            Output:
                                            
                -->|20|-->|30|-->|40|----
                |________________________|
