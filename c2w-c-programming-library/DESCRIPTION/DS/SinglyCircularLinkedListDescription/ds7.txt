        DELETE LAST NODE

    DESCRIPTION:

        In a circular Singly linked list, the last node of the list contains a pointer to the first node of the list. 
        We traverse the circular singly linked list until we reach the same node where we started. The circular singly 
        linked list has no beginning or end. No null value is present in the next part of any of the nodes
        
        The last node of the singly circular linked list can be deleted as follows:
        
        1.Reach the last node of the singly Linked List.
        2.Make the second last node point to first element.
        3.free() the last node.

                |________________________________|
            
            Output:
                                            
                ---->|10|-->|20|-->|30|----
