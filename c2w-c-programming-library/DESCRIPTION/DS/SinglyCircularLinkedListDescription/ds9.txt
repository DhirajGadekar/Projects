    SELECTED METHOD:

        ADD NODE AT POSITION

    DESCRIPTION:

        In a circular Singly linked list, the last node of the list contains a pointer to the first node of the list. 
        We traverse the circular singly linked list until we reach the same node where we started. The circular singly 
        linked list has no beginning or end. No null value is present in the next part of any of the nodes
        
        Insertion of a new node after some node in a singly Circular linked list is carried out in the following manner:

        1.Reach the desired node after which the new node is to be inserted.
        2.Make the newnode point to the next node of current node.
        3.Make current node's next to newnode.

      EXAMPLE:

            Input:

                ---->|10|-->|20|-->|30|-->|40|----
                |________________________________|
            
            Output:
                                            
                ---->|10|-->|20|-->|30|-->|60|-->|40|----
                |___________________________|___________|
                                            |
                                           newnode added
