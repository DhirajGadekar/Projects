        DELETE NODE AT POSITION

    DESCRIPTION:

        In a circular Singly linked list, the last node of the list contains a pointer to the first node of the list. 
        We traverse the circular singly linked list until we reach the same node where we started. The circular singly 
        linked list has no beginning or end. No null value is present in the next part of any of the nodes
        
        The deletion after a specific node can be formed in the following way,

        1.Reach the desired node after which the node is to be deleted.
        2.Make the current node's next point to the next of next element.
        3.A node to be deleted say temp, free() temp.
