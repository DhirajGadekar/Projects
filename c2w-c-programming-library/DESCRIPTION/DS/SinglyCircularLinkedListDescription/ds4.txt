        PRINT NODES IN LINKEDLIST

    DESCRIPTION:

        In a circular Singly linked list, the last node of the list contains a pointer to the first node of the list. 
        We traverse the circular singly linked list until we reach the same node where we started. The circular singly 
        linked list has no beginning or end. No null value is present in the next part of any of the nodes
        
        1.To display the entire singly linked list, we need to traverse it from first to last.
        2.using temp variable we can move ahead till we don't find the head.

      EXAMPLE:

                ---->|10|-->|20|-->|30|-->|40|----
