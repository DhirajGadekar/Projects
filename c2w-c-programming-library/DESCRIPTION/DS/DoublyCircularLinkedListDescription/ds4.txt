        PRINT NODES IN LINKEDLIST

    DESCRIPTION:

        Circular Doubly Linked List has properties of both doubly linked list and circular linked list in which 
        two consecutive elements are linked or connected by the previous and next pointer and the last node points 
        to the first node by the next pointer and also the first node points to the last node by the previous pointer. 
    
     
        1.To display the entire doubly circular linked list, we need to traverse it from first to last.
        2.In contrast to arrays, linked list nodes cannot be accessed randomly. Hence to reach the n-th element,
        we are bound to traverse through all (n-1) elements.
        3.Since the entire linked list is traversed, the operation costs us O(N) time complexity.

    EXAMPLE:
 
		   |--><--|10|<-->|20|<-->|30|<-->|40|--><--|
                   |________________________________________|
