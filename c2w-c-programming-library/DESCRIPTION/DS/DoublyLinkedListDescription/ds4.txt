        PRINT NODES IN LINKEDLIST

    DESCRIPTION:

        A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called the previous pointer, 
        together with the next pointer and data which are there in the singly linked list.Doubly Linked list 
        can be traversed in both forward and backward directions. 

        1.To display the entire doubly linked list, we need to traverse it from first to last.
        2.In contrast to arrays, linked list nodes cannot be accessed randomly. Hence to reach the n-th element,
        we are bound to traverse through all (n-1) elements.
        3.Since the entire linked list is traversed, the operation costs us O(N) time complexity.

    EXAMPLE:

        NULL<--|10|<-->|20|<-->|30|<-->|40|-->NULL
