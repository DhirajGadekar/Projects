		ADD NODE

    DESCRIPTION:
	      
        A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called the previous pointer,
        together with the next pointer and data which are there in the singly linked list. Doubly Linked 
        list can be traversed in both forward and backward directions. 
    
        Insertion of a new node at the end of a doubly linked list is performed in the following way:

        1.Traverse the list from start and reach the last node.
        2.Make the last node point to the new node.
        3.Make previous of newnode to last node.
        3.Make the new node point to null, marking the end of the list. 
        4.Inserting a new node at the end is an O(N) operation.

	EXAMPLE:

        Input:
            NULL<--|10|<-->|20|<-->|30|<-->|40|-->NULL

        Output:
            NULL<--|10|<-->|20|<-->|30|<-->|40|<--|50|-->NULL
                                                    |
                                                    |
                                                  newNode
