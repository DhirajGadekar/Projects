        DELETE NODE AT POSITION

    DESCRIPTION:
	      
        A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called the previous pointer,
        together with the next pointer and data which are there in the singly linked list. Doubly Linked 
        list can be traversed in both forward and backward directions. 

        The deletion after a specific node can be formed in the following way,

        1.Reach the desired node after which the node is to be deleted.
        2.Make the current node's next point to the next of next element.
        3.A node to be deleted say temp,make temp's next of previous equal to current node.
        4.free() temp.

	EXAMPLE:

        Input:
            NULL<--|10|<-->|20|<-->|30|<-->|40|-->NULL
            Pos:2

    Output:
            NULL<--|10|<-->|30|<--->|40|--->NULL
