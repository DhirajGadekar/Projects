    ADD NODE AT POSITION

  DESCRIPTION:
	      
      A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called the previous pointer,
      together with the next pointer and data which are there in the singly linked list. Doubly Linked 
      list can be traversed in both forward and backward directions. 

      Insertion of a new node after some node in a doubly linked list is carried out in the following manner:

      1.Reach the desired node after which the new node is to be inserted.
      2.Make the newnodes's previous current node and newnode's next to current node's next.
      3.Make current node's next to newnode.
      4.newnodes's next say temp , make temp's previous newnode.

	EXAMPLE:

      Input:
        NULL<--|10|<-->|20|<-->|30|<-->|40|-->NULL

      Output:
        NULL<--|10|<--->|20|<--->|50|<--->|30|<--->|40|--->NULL
                                  |
                                  |
                                newNode
