		ADD NODE AT FIRST

    DESCRIPTION:
	      
        A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called the previous pointer,
        together with the next pointer and data which are there in the singly linked list. Doubly Linked 
        list can be traversed in both forward and backward directions. 
    
        Insertion of a new node at the start of a doubly linked list is carried out in the following manner.

        1.Make the newnode's next point to HEAD.
        2.Make the previous of first node to newnode.
        3.Make head to point to newnode.

	EXAMPLE:

        Input:
            NULL<--|10|<-->|20|<-->|30|<-->|40|-->NULL

        Output:
            
            NULL--|50|<-->|10|<-->|20|<-->|30|<-->|40|-->NULL
                    |
                    |
                newNode
