        A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called the previous pointer,
        together with the next pointer and data which are there in the singly linked list. Doubly Linked 
        list can be traversed in both forward and backward directions.

        1.Make the HEAD point to its next element.
        2.Make next node's previous NULL.
        3.free()first node.

            NULL<--|10|<-->|20|<-->|30|<-->|40|-->NULL

        Output:
            NULL<--|20|<-->|30|<-->|40|-->NULL
